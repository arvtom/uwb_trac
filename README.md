My BA thesis: beacon based object tracking using UAV. Navigation is performed using UWB distance measurement. Quadcopter altitude, distance and angle to beacon is controlled using PID algorithm. Flight data is displayed in real time on a LCD display and saved to a microSD card.  

Summary can be found in .pdf slides.
